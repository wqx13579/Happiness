# Happiness Project Proposal

## 1. *Team Members: Qingxu Wang, Zening Li*

## 2.*Problem and Motivation:*
### Fit the model of happiness related to region of the world, GDP per Capita, family wellness, health conditions, freedom and some other factors.

### The purpose of this study is to understand what are the main factors making people happy, so we can commit more energy on those main factors.

## 3. *Libraries and Tools needed:*
### Statistical testing, Cloud computing basics(AWS EC2, S3, IAM etc.). We need to learn the Stats model for linear regression, statsmodels and sklearn for logistic regression, and model evaluation and selection.

## 4. *Data Collection Details:*
Happiness Data for 2015,2016 and 2017 from Kaggle:

[https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2015.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2015.csv)

[https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2016.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2016.csv)

[https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2017.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness#2017.csv)

## 5. *Literature Review(if any):*

## 6. *Work before build model:*
### We need to clean up the data. The reason is that some attributes we do not need to use so we need to remove these data. We need to have some hypothesis . For example, Is GDP per Capita affect the happiness and what is the future result of GDP per Capita related to happiness.

## 7. *Predictive Task and model detail, model evaluation and selection strategy:*
### We want to use the existence data to predict the future result. We wish to use linear regression to create the model. We wish to find what is affect the happiness so we wish to use GDP per Capita, family wellness, health conditions, freedom and some other factors to predict which factor will affect the happiness more in the future.

## 8. *How to test the model:*
