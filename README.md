# Happiness Project Proposal

## 1. *Team Members: Qingxu Wang, Zening Li*

## 2.*Problem and Motivation:*
### Fit the model of happiness related to region of the world, GDP per Capita, family wellness, health conditions, freedom and some other factors.

### The purpose of this study is to understand what are the main factors making people happy, so we can commit more energy on those main factors.

## 3. *Libraries and Tools needed:*
### Statistical testing, Cloud computing basics(AWS EC2, S3, IAM etc.). We need to learn the Stats model for linear regression, statsmodels and sklearn for logistic regression, and model evaluation and selection.

## 4. *Data Collection Details:*
Happiness Data for 2015,2016 and 2017 from Kaggle:
